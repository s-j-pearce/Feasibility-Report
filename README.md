# Feasibility-Report
### What is a feasibility report?
A feasibility report is an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of an existing or planned project or system. It is a comprehensive report that examines in detail the **five frames of analysis** of a given project or system. It also takes into consideration its **four Ps**, its **risks** and **POVs**, and its **constraints** (calendar, costs, and norms of quality). The goal is to determine whether the project or system should go ahead, be redesigned, or abandoned altogether.

The five frames of analysis are: 
* The frame of definition 
* The frame of contextual risks
* The frame of potentiality
* The parametric frame
* The frame of dominant and contingency strategies.

The four Ps are traditionally defined as Plan, Processes, People, and Power. 

The risks are considered to be external to the project, for instance the weather. These are divided into eight categories:
* (Plan) financial and organizational 
* (Processes) environmental and technological
* (People) marketing and sociocultural
* (Power) legal and political

POVs are Points of Vulnerability: they are different from risks in the sense that they are internal to the project and can be controlled or eliminated.

The constraints are the standard constraints of calendar, costs and norms of quality that can each be objectively determined and measured along the entire project lifecycle. Depending on projects, portions of the study may suffice to produce a feasibility study; smaller projects, for example, may not require an exhaustive environmental assessment. 
### Features of a feasability report:
* Gives focus to the project and outlines the alternatives.

* Narrows down business alternatives

* Identifies new opportunities through the investigative process.

* Identifies reasons not to proceed.

* Enhances the probability of success by addressing factors early on that could affect the project.

* Provides quality information for decision making.

* Provides documentation and evidence that the business venture was thoroughly investigated.
### Purpose of a feasability report:
The purpose of a feasability report is to identify specific factors that could potentially hinder the projects progress as well as identify new oppertunities that may or may not have been initially discovered. The report will also evaluate the projects potential of success. In doing this, the report has to be conducted by an unbias body in order to provide the information so that decisions can be based off this report.
### Components of a feasability report:
* **Description of the Business**: Describes the product or services to be offered. 

* **Market Feasibility**: This includes a description of the industry, the current market, anticipated future market potential, competition, sales projections, and potential buyers.

* **Technical Feasibility**: This details how you will deliver your product or service, including issues of materials, labor, transportation, where your business will be located, and the technology needed. 

* **Financial Feasibility**: You should project how much startup capital you'll need and detail potential sources of capital and returns on investment.

* **Organizational Feasibility**: Define the legal and corporate structure of the business. You can also include professional background information about the founders and what skills they can contribute to the business.

* **Conclusions**: Discuss how the business can succeed. Be honest in your assessment because investors won't just look at your conclusions. They will also look at the data and will question your conclusions if they appear unrealistic.
